Page 1's summary: This paper introduces generative agents as computational software that simulate believable human behavior. These agents are capable of waking up, cooking, working, creating art, forming opinions, noticing others, and engaging in conversations. The architecture extends a large language model to store the agent's experiences in natural language, synthesize memories, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. The generative agents were instantiated in an interactive sandbox environment where users can interact with a small town of 25 agents using natural language. The evaluation demonstrated believable individual and emergent social behaviors, showing that observation, planning, and reflection are critical components of the agent architecture. The work aims to enable believable simulations of human behavior through the fusion of large language models with computational interactive agents.
Page 2's summary: This page describes a research paper on generative agents that simulate believable human behavior in an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims. The paper introduces an architecture that extends a large language model to store and retrieve the agents' experiences using natural language, enabling them to dynamically plan and reflect on their behavior. The generative agents autonomously exhibit individual and emergent social behaviors, and the paper presents evaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness of the architecture. The architecture and evaluations are considered to be significant contributions of the paper.

Additionally, it provides a brief overview of related work in human-AI interaction and creating believable proxies of human behavior.
Page 4's summary: This article discusses the concept of creating believable agents, which are designed to provide a simulation of human behavior in open-world environments such as video games. It explores various approaches to creating these agents, including rule-based methods and learning-based approaches using reinforcement learning. The article also introduces the concept of using large language models to generate believable behavior and discusses the potential of this approach in creating generative agents. It describes the use of large language models in generating human behavior for various purposes, such as social computing systems, gaming, and robotics tasks. The article then presents a proposed architecture for generative agents and describes their instantiation in a sandbox environment called Smallville, resembling The Sims.
Page 5's summary: This paper discusses the requirements for believable agents in virtual environments, proposing an agent architecture that utilizes a dynamic knowledge base and past experience at each time step. The author instantiates generative agents as characters in a sandbox world, Smallville, and describes the affordances and interactions with these agents. The agents are represented by sprite avatars and communicate with each other through natural language. They can be controlled by the user, who can intervene through conversation or by issuing directives to the agents.
Page 6's summary: This page describes a simulation environment called Smallville where generative agents interact with each other and with users. User controls include steering the simulation through conversation and issuing directives to agents. The environment includes affordances of a small village and agents' movements are directed by the generative agent architecture and sandbox game engine. Users and agents can influence the state of objects in the environment. The behavior of generative agents is demonstrated through a "day in the life" example, showing how agents plan their days, interact, and build relationships. The page also discusses emergent social behaviors, showing how information diffuses among the agents.
Page 7's summary: The page discusses emergent social behaviors of generative agents in Smallville. It describes how these agents exchange information, form relationships, and coordinate joint activities through behaviors like information diffusion, relationship memory, and coordination. It also explains the generative agent architecture, which aims to provide a framework for behavior in an open world by combining a large language model with mechanisms for synthesizing and retrieving relevant information. These mechanisms help the agents react based on past experiences, make inferences, and maintain long-term coherence.
Page 8's summary: This page discusses a generative agent architecture that uses a large language model to generate behaviors based on the agent's environment and past experiences. The architecture utilizes a memory stream to maintain a record of the agent's experiences and retrieves relevant memories to plan actions and react appropriately. It describes a retrieval function that selects pertinent memories to condition the language model's response and focuses on components such as recency and importance to effectively produce results.
Page 9's summary: The article discusses the challenge of creating generative agents that can simulate human behavior and the approach of maintaining a memory stream to address this. It proposes a retrieval function that selects relevant memories to pass on to the language model based on recency, importance, and relevance. Furthermore, it introduces the concept of reflections as higher-level, abstract thoughts generated periodically. The example of Klaus Mueller choosing who to spend time with based on observations illustrates the need for generalized inferences.
Page 10's summary: The page discusses a framework for generative agents that incorporates memory, reflection, planning, and reacting. It explains how a language model is used to calculate relevance, recency, and importance scores for memory retrieval. It also introduces the concept of reflections, which are higher-level, abstract thoughts generated by the agent, and describes a process for generating these reflections. Additionally, it addresses the challenge of planning coherent and believable future actions for the agent and proposes an approach for creating plans to ensure consistency in the agent's behavior over time.
Page 11's summary: This page discusses the process of generating high-level insights based on agents' actions and reflections, the importance of planning and reacting for generative agents, and the generation of plans, reactions, and dialogue for agents based on their observed actions and memories of each other.

The evaluation procedure is described, along with different conditions used for comparison, and the involvement of human evaluators in assessing the believability of agent responses.
Page 14's summary: This page presents a study comparing the believability of interview responses generated by different agent architectures and a human author condition. The experiment involved 100 participants and evaluated the responses' believability. It compared generative agent architectures to ablations that disabled the agents' access to different types of memory and included a human roleplay condition. Human evaluators evaluated the conditions, and the study found that the full architecture of generative agents produced the most believable behavior. The study utilized TrueSkill rating, statistical tests, and qualitative analysis to support its findings.
